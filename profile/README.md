Welcome to FluxTeam.

We, as FluxTeam, are a group of people that came together from different locations and tries to create innovative interfaces that everybody can reach and use. Our main purpose is to present interfaces, services and apps that everyone is used to by making them a whole new experience for the user and do this with the best of our ability.

We currently make Discord bots which are made by different team members. But it is not a limitation for us, so we can always come up with something different. Stay tuned on our Discord server!
